# Refactoring Progress Log

This log tracks the progress of refactoring the application from CustomTkinter to Streamlit, following the instructions in `AGENT.md`.

## Phase 1: Foundation Building

### Step 1: Create New Directory Structure (Completed)
- Created the `agent-web` directory.
- Created the new modular directory structure (`config`, `modules`, `static`, etc.).
- Moved all existing source code from `src` and `tests` into the new structure under `agent-web`.
- Removed the old `src` and `tests` directories.

### Step 2: Create New Files based on AGENT.md (Completed)
- Created `agent-web/app.py` with the main Streamlit application code.
- Created `agent-web/static/custom.css` with the specified styles.
- Created `agent-web/Dockerfile` for containerization.
- Created `agent-web/cloudbuild.yaml` for GCP deployment.
- Added `__init__.py` files to all necessary directories to make them Python packages.

### Step 3: Update `requirements.txt` (Completed)
- Created `agent-web/requirements.txt` with the new list of dependencies for the Streamlit application.

### Step 4: Create Placeholder Modules (Completed)
- Created the initial versions of the modules required by `app.py`:
  - `modules/ui/chat_interface.py`
  - `modules/ui/sidebar.py`
  - `modules/auth/identity_platform.py`
- Created empty config files:
  - `config/settings.py`
  - `config/gcp_config.py`

### Next Steps
- Continue with the implementation of the modules as outlined in `AGENT.md`.
- Begin Phase 2: Authentication and Security.

## Phase 1.5: Code Refinement & Review

### Step 1: Implement LLMClient (Completed)
- Created `agent-web/modules/utils/llm_client.py` as specified in `AGENT.md`.

### Step 2: Implement Agent Loading (Completed)
- Refactored `ReActAgent`, `CoTAgent`, and `ToTAgent` to use the new `LLMClient`.
- Implemented a `get_agent` factory function in `modules/agents/__init__.py` to instantiate agents correctly.
- Implemented a `get_tools_by_name` factory function in `modules/tools/__init__.py`.

### Step 3: Configure API Key Handling (Completed)
- Created `.streamlit/secrets.toml.example` to document the required API key.
- Updated the main `README.md` with instructions for running the new Streamlit app.

### Step 4: Adapt Agents to New Structure (Completed)
- Reviewed the agents and connected them to the Streamlit session's memory system.
- Updated `app.py` to initialize memory in the session state.
- Updated `get_agent` to pass the memory object to the agents.

### Step 5: Fix Basic Test (Skipped)
- Attempted to fix `test_cot_agent.py`.
- The test file was refactored for the new structure.
- **Blocked** by a persistent issue with the `run_in_bash_session` tool's environment, which prevents running `pytest`. This step was skipped as per user instruction.
